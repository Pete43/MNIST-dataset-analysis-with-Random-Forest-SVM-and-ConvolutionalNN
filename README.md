# MNIST-dataset-analysis-with-Random-Forest-and-Support-Vector-Machine

Addressing the MNIST Dataset problem using Random Forest Classifier 

1) using sklearn we build a classifier as random forest with 100 trees in the forest and 10 job parallely running capacity

2) undergone testing training split for data set where the testing hold out is 10% 

3) calculated score by fitting the testing data in the pickled model
